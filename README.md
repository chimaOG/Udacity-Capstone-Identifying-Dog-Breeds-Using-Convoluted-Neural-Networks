# Udacity-Capstone-Identifying-Dog-Breeds-Using-Convoluted-Neural-Networks

The project was executed in a Udacity workspace and data for the project was already loaded into the workspace. The data for training the CNN can, however, be downloaded here.

The project is part of the Udacity nanodegree program and the end product is an algorithm that will use a CNN to do the following when supplied an image as input:
1. Detect human faces in the input image
2. Detect dog faces in the input image
3. Predict the dogâ€™s breed if it detects a dog
4. Predict the dog breed that most resembles any human face it detects

Details about the project are discussed extensively in this report: https://medium.com/@samuelogbonna30/udacity-capstone-identifying-dog-breeds-using-convoluted-neural-networks-c266cfd42b80
